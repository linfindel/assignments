  <h1>The Internet of Things</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The Internet of Things is the interconnected network of devices with sensors, processing ability, and software which share information using the Internet.
    It is used in many different sectors such as agriculture, industry, healthcare, and smart homes.
    Data collection devices normally feed data into a central processing centre where it is processed by more powerful servers.
    Sometimes, the servers can send data to output devices such as a screen or actuators.
  </p>

  <p>
    This report has been commissioned by the director of a company specialising in burglar alarms.
    They wish to investigate the possibility of integrating Internet of Things technologies into their products and services.

  <h2>IoT Systems and Services in Different Sectors</h2>
  <h3>Smart Home</h3>

  <p>
    A smart home is a house which has been fitted with various devices such as cameras and sensors.
    These are connected using the Internet to the smart home provider's cloud infrastructure which processes the input and sends signals to output devices such as speakers, screens, and lights.
    This can be useful for many functions such as home security, accessibility, and automation.
    For example, if an intruder is detected by a camera, an alarm will ring and the home owner will be notified.
    A wheelchair user can ask their digital assistant to turn off the lights without having to move themselves over to the light switch.
    Someone can set up their thermostat to keep the house at a comfortable temperature when they are not at home.
  </p>

  <p>
    One device used in a smart home is the smart speaker.
    This is usually the central device in a smart home network since it controls everything.
    A smart speaker is a small computer with a microphone, speaker, and an artificial intelligence model to process voice commands.
    Some popular examples are:
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <button onclick="window.open('https://www.amazon.com/b?node=21576558011', '_blank')">
      <img src="images/alexa.svg" alt="The Amazon Alexa logo">

      <h2>Amazon Alexa</h2>
    </button>

    <button onclick="window.open('https://assistant.google.com/', '_blank')">
      <img src="images/google-assistant.svg" alt="The Google Assistant logo">

      <h2>Google Assistant</h2>
    </button>

    <button onclick="window.open('https://www.apple.com/siri/', '_blank')">
      <img src="images/siri.svg" alt="The Siri logo">

      <h2>Siri</h2>
    </button>
  </div>

  <p>
    A smart speaker can be very useful.
    They are very good for accessibility: people who can't use conventional computers can access content on the Internet easily.
    They are also very helpful for people who, due to various accessibility reasons, prefer to speak to use a computer.
    They also offer a central control point from which a user can control every other device.
    For example, rather than turning off every light in the house manually, a user can ask their smart speaker to do it for them instantly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Smart speakers also have a lot of challenges and concerns.
    There are serious privacy and security risks to having a microphone constantly recording everything that happens in the home.
    This data is unethically collected and used by the company, often without users' consent or knowledge, for training of AI models (especially for voice recognition and synthesis).
    There are allegations that Google and Amazon use recordings of private conversations to recommend targeted advertisements to their users.
    Also, if the company does not have strong cybersecurity provisions, these recording and a large volume of other assorted sensitive data might be vulnerable to unauthorised access.
    Many criminal groups and governments could use this information to extort or harm users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another device used in a smart home is a smart doorbell.
    These are doorbells with cameras fitted so that the person at the door can either communicate with the home owner or leave a message.
    They can either be wired or wireless.
    The most popular brand is Ring.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <button onclick="window.open('https://en-uk.ring.com/', '_blank')">
      <img src="images/ring.svg" alt="The Ring logo" id="ring">

      <h2>Ring</h2>
    </button>
  </div>

  <p>
    A smart doorbell has quite a few benefits.
    It allows users to respond to people at their door remotely.
    It will alert the user of suspicious behaviour.
    The user can set it up to deliver specific instructions to delivery drivers on where to place packages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Smart doorbells also have many drawbacks.
    There are legal and privacy concerns around the unauthorised recording of passers-by, especially considering what unethical purposes the doorbell company might use the data for.
    Also, smart doorbells are often on subscription models which are very predatory.
  </p>

  <h2>Agriculture</h2>

  <p>
    The Internet of Things has many applications in farming.
    Data collection is especially prevalent as it allows farmers to make more informed decisions, reduce waste and maximise efficiency, and automate farming techniques.
