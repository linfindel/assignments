  <h1>The Internet of Things</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The Internet of Things is the interconnected network of devices with sensors, processing ability, and software which share information using the Internet.
    It is used in many different sectors such as agriculture, industry, healthcare, and smart homes.
    Data collection devices normally feed data into a central processing centre where it is processed by more powerful servers.
    Sometimes, the servers can send data to output devices such as a screen or actuators.

    This report has been commissioned by the director of a company specialising in burglar alarms.
    They wish to investigate the possibility of integrating Internet of Things technologies into their products and services.

  <h3>Smart Home</h3>

  <p>
    A smart home is a house which has been fitted with various devices such as cameras and sensors.
    These are connected using the Internet to the smart home provider's cloud infrastructure which processes the input and sends signals to output devices such as speakers, screens, and lights.
    This can be useful for many functions such as home security, accessibility, and automation.
    For example, if an intruder is detected by a camera, an alarm will ring and the home owner will be notified.
    A wheelchair user can ask their digital assistant to turn off the lights without having to move themselves over to the light switch.
