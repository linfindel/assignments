  <h1>The Internet of Things</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
    The Internet of Things is the interconnected network of devices with sensors, processing ability, and software which share information using the Internet.
    It is used in many different sectors such as agriculture, industry, healthcare, and smart homes.
    Data collection devices normally feed data into a central processing centre where it is processed by more powerful servers.
    Sometimes, the servers can send data to output devices such as a screen or actuators.

    This report has been commissioned by the director of a company specialising in burglar alarms.
    They wish to investigate the possibility of integrating Internet of Things technologies into their products and services.

  <h2>IoT Systems and Services in Different Sectors</h2>
  <h3>Smart Home</h3>

  <p>
    A smart home is a house which has been fitted with various devices such as cameras and sensors.
    These are connected using the Internet to the smart home provider's cloud infrastructure which processes the input and sends signals to output devices such as speakers, screens, and lights.
    This can be useful for many functions such as home security, accessibility, and automation.
    For example, if an intruder is detected by a camera, an alarm will ring and the home owner will be notified.
    A wheelchair user can ask their digital assistant to turn off the lights without having to move themselves over to the light switch.
    Someone can set up their thermostat to keep the house at a comfortable temperature when they are not at home.

  <p>
    One device used in a smart home is the smart speaker.
    This is usually the central device in a smart home network since it controls everything.
    A smart speaker is a small computer with a microphone, speaker, and an artificial intelligence model to process voice commands.
    Some popular examples are:
